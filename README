A PDF API tutorial entitled, "Creating PDF Documents with Synergy", can be
found at http://tutorials.synergex.com. To access the tutorial, you will need
to download the tutorials client app (from the site), which will then present
you with a list of available tutorials from which to choose.

The PDF API is dependent on MSVCR100.DLL and it needs to be in the path.
Try looking for it in C:\Windows\System32\ or C:\Windows\SysWOW64\
